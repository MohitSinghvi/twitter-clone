# TwitterClone

This is an application which call backend APIs of https://github.com/MohitSinghvi/twitter-clone-service, which internally calls the twitter v2 APIs to authenticate, create and delete the tweets on behalf of the logged in twitter user.
<br>
The Application has a login page which redirects user to Twitter page, where user can authenticate with their twitter credentials after which the user is again redirected to create tweet page.
<br>
After login, user can write a tweet and post it, and also delete it on this user interface.

Unit testing of the APIs is done using Karma for Angular.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
